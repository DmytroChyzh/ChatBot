Solution ,,,,,,
"Platform that will provide capabilities for BruhnPartner to create reports and share them with customers. Customers will have access to the reports, will be able to view and explore data. 
Customers may have multiple reports over time. 

At this stage reports will be created by analysts manually (no algorythms or automation of input processing). ",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Roles ,,,,,,
Consultant,- Ability to create reports ,,,,,
Admin ,"- Ability to create entities, assign role & permission (customers & invite analysts) ",,,,,
Customer ,- View reports ,,,,,
,,,,,,
Overview,,,,,,
"    - The platform shall support 3 user roles: Consultant, Customer and Admin.
    - On Customer’s side permissions could also be granted per study or other entity (e.g. geography or department). This TBD in more detail.
    - Dashboards (aka reports, studies) shall have standard structure with minimal flexibility - to add/remove some blocks (aka “widget”).
    - Dashboard is prepared by the Consultant and shared with the Customer by inviting to the platform via email (the current process also covers personal/remote meeting, so probably it will be shared afterwards).
    - Customer can have multiple studies over time to which he/she should have access.
    - Dashboard for a customer will be created by the Consultant be selecting “widget” and uploading processed data data to the platform
    - Dashboards can be branded by name & logo of the customer",,,,,,
,,,,,,
In Scope ,,,,,,
"- Interface for the Cunsultant to create Dashboards
- Interface for the Customer to access and preview dashboard. Ability to export pdf/png.
- Interface for Admin (manage of the company) to manage users: employee access and customer access. (+ same capability as a Consultant).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Out of scope ,,,,,,
"- No data processing at this stage - charts and graphs will be populated by the Consultant uploading processed data.
- No review and approval process at this stage - there will be no feature for Admin (company’s manager) to approve dashboard before submitting it to the customer.
- Submitting of survey request is conducted via direct contact, not via the portal.",,,,,,
