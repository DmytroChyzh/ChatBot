About,"CRM systems allow restaurants accurately maintain compliance and ensure that health, safety, and service standards are met. Automation of task management processes helps businesses to consistently meet and exceed brand standards. To conduct a discovery phase to identify main pain points in managing restaurants in Central Asia, identify opportunities and gaps. Based on the research findings, we designed a new platform to support setting up and scaling the restaurant. The solution comprised two products (web app and mobile app) is in active implementation phase. Managing a business is very complicated work - you must keep an eye on multiple directions simultaneously, have all processes properly set up, and have the proper tools on hand to assist you while monitoring and controlling all moving parts. We tried to create a SaaS solution for an early phase startup focused on small and medium restaurants, that would help to create and run a business in the Middle East region.
