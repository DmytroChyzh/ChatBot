About Refmax,"We had already been working with this client on another UX design project, and the CIO approached us, asking if we could assist with the product discovery for a new solution they intended to launch quickly. Soon our collaboration turned into a full user experience design for the product.

The solution was in the real estate domain, for brokerage and real estate agencies all over the world. It contained three cornerstone blocks of the system: management of property listings, management of leads and clients, and website builder for quick and easy creation of personalized webpages. It was part of a larger product environment, which shared the same data sources. A solution of this kind is unique, though there are indirect competitors that cover certain features.",,

Testing,,,It is highly recommended to validate design decisions with real users. Upon user feedback we can adjust flows or UX to meet real user needs. 
- preparation,,,Create prototype + write script for usability testing + schedule meetings. Depending on the complexity of the flow it can be 2-6h
- conduct testing,,,Depending on the complexity of the prototype 30min - 1h 
- process results,,,15min after each testing + 30in-1h to process overall results
